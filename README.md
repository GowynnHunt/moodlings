# About
My beautiful wife has decided that it's time to put my coding skills to work for her benefit. She wants to create a quiz website that can tell people what kind of dog they are most like.

The website should be cute and contain humorous content.

## Goal
She spent some time drawing how she thinks the website should end up looking:

After some thought, I'm going to need to change most of what I've written so far along with (hopefully) making it easier to manipulate. We both agreed that it should probably just be the "Holy Grail" of web design:
