      <h1>Welcome to Moodlings</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! Thanks so much for coming to Moodlings. Here we like to try and
        figure out the strange and exciting things about people. How do we do
        that you ask? Well through quizzes of course!
      </p>

    <div id="pup-quiz" class="container">
      <h2>Which pup are you?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever stopped to ponder, "Gee, I wonder what kind of dog I am.
        If only there were some sort of eccentric, online quiz that could answer
        this age old question for me."
      </p>
      <p>If that sounds like you, you're in the right place!</p>
      <p>
        Through a complex, integrated algorithm, we will ask you a series of
        fundamental questions that will allow us to calculate what type of dog
        you are with 99.85% accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be warned, after you take this quiz, you may experience deep and
        provoking introspection, unlike anything you have ever experienced. If
        you are ready to confront the canine inside, please press the button
        below...
